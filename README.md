# EDBrain
## From ICDE paper: **_**EDBrain: Efficient Cache Tuning for Embedded Databases**_**

## How to use:
1. Need a TPC-C benchmark .db SQLite database file and specify its location in the config.ini file.
2. Make sure that Python has SQLite3 support enabled.
3. Run the main function in the main.py file. The code will output the selected model for each database.

It is important to note that this part of the code is a relatively simple implementation.
